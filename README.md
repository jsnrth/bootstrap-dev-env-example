# Automated Dev Environment Bootstrapping

This is an example of how we bootstrap our developer environments at VictorOps. It uses a handful of very useful tools to get consistent environments, automatically, with the goal of [dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity).

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Good 'ol bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
